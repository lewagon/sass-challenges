## Background & Objectives

In this challenge, you will adopt a very clean organization of our styleheets, and you will use SASS variables, chaining and nesting to have a concise but efficient design.


## Specs

Here is a roadmap of things to do:

1. Change **`config/variables.css.scss`** and **`config/bootstrap_variables.css.scss`** with your own values for colors and fonts.
1. Import you old CSS code by creating stylesheets **well-named** and **located in the good folder** (`layout`? `pages`? `components`?**). Take your time to think about where to write your CSS code.

When that's done:

1. Clean all your css code using **SASS variables**, selector **nesting** & **chaining**. No more duplication!
1. Check if all your CSS classes are essential of if you can replace some of them by Bootstrap classes.


## Commit & Deploy

Once you're done:

1. Commit and publish you change using Github app.
1. Don't forget to deploy your site with the deploy script.
